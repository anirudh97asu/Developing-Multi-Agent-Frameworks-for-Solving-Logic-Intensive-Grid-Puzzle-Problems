Skip repeating the original clues - assume they're already understood.\n\n2. Start immediately with meaningful deductions derived from combining and analyzing clues.\n\n3. For each numbered deduction step:\n   - Present only the NEW inference or conclusion reached\n   - Briefly explain which constraints led to this conclusion\n   - Show any concrete mappings or assignments that result (X = Y, A cannot be B, etc.)\n\n4. Include specific variable assignments and eliminations in your steps (e.g., \"Wine A must be from 1988\" or \"Person B cannot have the red car\").\n\n5. Focus on recording the mapping progression - which variables have been definitively assigned and which possibilities have been eliminated.\n\n6. Document crucial decision points and branching logic when necessary.\n\n7. Each step must contribute new information toward the solution without repeating previous deductions.\n\n8. When appropriate, summarize the current state of the solution grid after significant deductions.\n\nYour output should read like the step-by-step solution path in a puzzle solver's notebook, and do not return any solution directly.",
